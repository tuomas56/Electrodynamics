#Electrodynamics

This mod is **in development** and is open source for your enjoyment.

Electrodynamics is copyrighted by [CyanideX](https://github.com/CyanideX "CyanideX GitHub profile").

This mod is not to be used in any modpacks until a stable release is available. We do not wish to receive complaints or bug reports based on bugs we either already know about or that have been fixed in newer builds. Furthermore, we do not wish to be blamed for broken world saves or lag on a server... that is what our testing team is for.

#Release

[Alpha v0.1.3.3 for 1.6.2] (https://www.dropbox.com/s/o2vrqzifj7x1ncr/Electrodynamics-Alpha-0.1.3.3.jar?dl=1 "Direct Download")

#Compiling
//TODO Freshen this bit up

For most users, simply install gradle 1.6, pull the most recent code, and run setup.bat or setup.sh. Then to build run gradle build

If you need to have the code build in a directory other than the working directory, run ant [target] -Dsrc.dir=[dir]

Valid targets are setup, jenkins, build, and initial_build. You can look through the script to figure out what these actually do.
